smallest code:
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
    return (s.length() == goal.length())
            && ((s+s).indexOf(goal) != -1);
    }
}




Naive Approach: Follow the given steps to solve the problem

Find all the positions of the first character of the original string in the string to be checked.
For every position found, consider it to be the starting index of the string to be checked.
Beginning from the new starting index, compare both strings and check whether they are equal or not.
(Suppose the original string to is s1, string to be checked to be s2,n is the length of strings and j is the position of the
first character of s1 in s2, then for i < (length of original string) , check if s1[i]==s2[(j+1)%n). Return false if any character
mismatch is found, else return true.
Repeat 3rd step for all positions found.
